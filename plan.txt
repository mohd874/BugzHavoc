- create new repo BugzHavoc2
- draw a circle in the screen. this will simulate the player
- move the circle using the accelerometer
- draw border around the screen edge
- when the circle touches the border, it goes back to the center of the screen (simulating death)
- draw triangles (start with 3) in the screen. those are the enemies
- make the triangles follow the circle. the triangles must rotate to the target while is moves forward.
- when the circle touches the triangle, it goes back to the center of the screen (simulating death)
- when triangles touches the border, they get removed
- draw scores on the top right on the screen
- the score must increase for each removed triangle
- add weapons bench to the screen. the bench is a rectangle on the top of the screen
- update the border size so it does not overlap the bench.
- add weapon "glue" to the bench
- when the glue is clicked, it will be highlighted. glue will be represented as hexagon
- then when you click anywhere inside the border, it will be spilled in that place. 
- the glue will stop the motion of any triangles that goes over it.
